# Art Of It All - v0.1 - Home Page Styling Complete
The idea of this is displaying art from different artists for sale. 
Also, allowing customers to make personal requests for pieces of art they would like made. 
The site would also be an opportunity to help the artist get a foothold in the industry, 
for exposure and learning how to handle these types of situations before doing it on their own. 
The interaction I want for this are:-
* I'd like to use a market basket API; this hopefully would allow customers to add items to the basket for a later checkout
* I'd like to use an API that analyses the colour of the picture and suggest colours for walls
* I'd like to use a Google login API to allow customers to login and checkout with Google Pay
* I'd like to use an email API to send a response from a submitted form with the information about a job
* I'd like an API that is a calendar that shows how much work an artist has at the moment, 
 displaying how long it may take for a customers piece to complete. 

## UX

This website will have two target audiences. 
The first is customers who are looking into or wanting to buy art for there home. 
Also, customers that wish to request their ideas to be made. 
The other main target is the artists that want to get into the industry who need a little help getting their foot in the door.

For the customers, the site will be designed with ease of access in mind as much as possible. 
So, to achieve this, the navigation, login, header and light/dark toggle will be on a bar that sticks to the top of the page, 
I will do this so when they scroll; they can still navigate, change the theme and login or out without needing to scroll to the top of the page. 
Also, in the direction of ease of access navigation links to make searching the market place easier will be present to the market navigation tab in a dropdown menu. 
There will also be a few pages that explain how all these services work so they can read them and to help 
this there will be a contact form that they can complete to talk to Help department about any issues.

For artists, their art will display on the market page and past requests page. 
On these pages, there will be a description of the making process, 
the artist and the artist's thoughts on the piece. 
These descriptions will help the artist because it will help them learn how to show off their work, 
learn what types of questions they should be asking themselves when showing off their work and finally 
will help them start getting noticed in the artist industry. The contact form that customers can use to contact 
them will help the artist to understand interactions with customers and will help them learn to handle 
specific requests from customers. By this, I mean learn how to help customers get there idea created while also letting them know what is achievable.

For the design of the page, I will be using the Bootstrap grid method to make the page look organised and well-spaced. 
It will help with the response to smaller screen sizes for a better layout of all of the features. 
Also, for the design of the pages, a title will be at the top in the large text. So customers are reassured which page they are on. 
I hope to reinforce this with the current page highlighted on the navigation.

User Stories:-
Art enthusiast wants more art for there home; they want more landscapes. 
They open up on the home page and see a link to "Landscapes for Sale". 
They click on this and go to the market place with landscapes selected on the filter. 
They want fantasy designs, so they choose the fantasy filter. 
They find some pieces they like but want this to look it's best in there home, 
so they use the wall colour chooser to look at suggestions to paint their wall.

A fan of tattoos wants a personal design done, but they're not sure how to design it themselves. 
They see "Past Requested Art" and click the link to see what's there. They come across loads of designs; they find a filter for "Tattoos". 
When they see loads of good designs by one particular artist, they follow the link that says "Please use the Contact page to make personal requests!". 
They find the artist they want on the dropdown list of artist and write there request out.

A customer wants to make a personal request but isn't entirely sure how to go about it, 
they have managed to navigate to the contact page but is not sure how it should be laid out and not sure about what to say. 
They see the link for help at the top of the page before the request for; they click the link that leads them to the policies page and see "Request Details" subpage link. 
They look through the suggestions here on layout and what to say and head back to the contacts page through the navigation to make their request.

An artist gets a request but isn't sure how to handle it. 
They have managed to navigate to the Policies page and has had a look through its subpages but is still unsure. 
They then decide to try and get further help, on the Policies page they notice a help link,

## Technologies Used

### Bootstrap
Used for the page and specific HTML element styling. Its primary use at the moment is its grid method for page format and look on smaller screens

### JQuery
Used for more effortless Javascript coding and dom manipulation

### Jasmine
Used to test Javascript code

### Font-Awesome
Used for a logo for different navigation links and some titles. Also used for social connections in the footer. Finally used for the dropdown logo on the navigation

### Google Font
Used for the font families for the whole page

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
